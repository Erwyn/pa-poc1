This first Proof Of Concept must study the models structure and provide
an easy-to-use API (and Python console).
1. The model structure must be developed and tested.  Even if no
   compatibility proof has to be given, the compatibility between
   multiple drivers must be carefully thought through.  The concept
   is simple: the model's have to be represented in Python code which
   MUST NOT change whatever the driver (PostgreSQL, MySQL...).  The MySQL
   driver will be the first one to be developed (through the pymysql
   library) but others must be easily added.
2. A Python API must provide access to the created models via classes
   and functions.  Firstly and above all, each model should provide
   functionalities for manipulating these objects (create, edit, show
   and delete) and the set of objects (get, filter).
3. A very useful tool which will be easy to deploy after those two
   first steps would be a Python console with an easy access to the
   developed API.  Thus, it should be easy to create, edit, show and
   delete informations via a simple method or function call.

Note: The future POCs should, if appliable, use the preview POCs to
      propose more functionalities.  This means that the directory
      structure, classes name and so forth could be changed, but
      those changes should be avoided if possible.
